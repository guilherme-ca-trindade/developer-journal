# Lecture 2 - Using Objects

## Abstraction
	- Definition: Abstraction involves ignoring irrelevant details
	- All programs require abstraction
		○ To keep things simple, model only relevant parts of a system and ignore irrelevant parts
		○ E.g. In a recipe app, no need to model molecular structure of icing

## Encapsulation
	- Recall: Encapsulation involves hiding implementation details
		○ Usually involves presenting an abstraction (often referred to as a "black box") to the 'outside world'
	- E.g. A function encapsulates the instructions in its body; its interface (name, parameters, and return type) is an abstraction
	- A clean interface has an appropriate level of abstraction
		○ Too much abstraction: not enough control
		○ Too little abstraction: code gets complex

## Function signatures

### >>Example:
> List<Recipe> filterRecipes (String ingredient) {
> 	Return List.of( );
> }

## Encapsulation
	- Strategy: write program components with clean interfaces, then compose those components…

	- So far, you have used functions as the main program component
		○ E.g. main function calls sequence of other functions; each other function may call further functions
	- In Object Oriented Programming (OOP), the main program components are objects

## Objects
	- An object encapsulates both…
		○ State (variables), and
		○ Behaviour (methods)
	- The state of an object may be changed/read using its methods

	- In OOP, programs are built by constructing a network of objects that work together to accomplish a computational 

	###  Example
		○ E.g. imagine a 'house' object
		○ State:
			§ Door closed
			§ No fire
		○ Behaviour:
			§ Open door
			§ Light fire

## Class (object types)
	- Recall: In Java, anything that is not one of the 8 primitive types is an object type or class
	- JDK has many built-in classes

## Class vs Objects
	### Class
		○ The 'blueprint'
		○ The code that defines the variables and methods common to one kind of object
	### Object
		○ A thing made from the blueprint
		○ A run-time, in-memory instance of a class

	### Object instances of the same class…
		○ All have the same behaviour
		○ But maybe different states
	
## Single Responsibility Principle
	- Typically, each class has a single responsibility
	- …

## Object Terminology
	- State usually referred to as one of:
		○ Instance variable
		○ Field
		○ Property
		○ Attribute
	- Behaviour usually referred as a method…

## Class interfaces
	- The public interface of a class consists of its public members
		○ Public variables (in Java, usually none-more on this later)
		○ Public methods
		○ Recall: public visibility means accessible from code outside of class
	- Private members are hidden (encapsulated) implementation details
		○ Private members can only be accessed from code inside the class

## Objects


### Constructor methods
	- Every class has a constructor method
	- Can be called to create a new object instance…
	- …


### Accessor and Mutator methods
	- Mutator methods change the state of the object
	- Accessor methods refer to instance variables but do not change them

## Class vs Instance methods
### Class variables
	- Associated with the type in general
	- Call using class name, as in Math.Pi( )
